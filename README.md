Currently in any embedded systems when an application that is running on an embedded platform is affected by intermittent supply. It would cause the application to stop and restart from the very beginning leading to waste of energy and computation power since all data is lost.  To avoid this a battery can be utilized but compared to use of battery any energy harvesting method is a better alternative but it is unstable in nature since the signal generated are generally stochastic. The aim of this paper is to save and restore the computed data which is done by selectively saving changed SRAM and general-purpose register contents into a nonvolatile memory (FRAM) during a power outage. Furthermore, it is required to remove any external dependent circuitry and trigger Hibernus purely through software means this new approach will reduce external circuit dependencies, energy utilization and the time required for hibernate process.
